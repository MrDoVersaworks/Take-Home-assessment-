# Header Bidding System Implementation

This document provides an overview of the implementation of a simplified header bidding system aimed at optimizing ad revenue for a publisher's website. The project leverages Prebid.js as the core framework and integrates multiple Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs). Key functionalities include dynamic floor pricing, bid validation, analytics tracking, and a CI/CD pipeline for seamless deployment.

## Overview

The header bidding system enables publishers to maximize competition for ad inventory by facilitating real-time bidding (RTB) through Prebid.js. This implementation is fully compliant with OpenRTB protocol requirements and incorporates advanced features such as lazy loading, fallback ads, and analytics integration.

## Features

### Core Features
1. **Prebid.js Setup:** Configured with two demand partners (AppNexus and Pubmatic).
2. **Ad Unit Configuration:** Supports responsive ad units for both desktop and mobile devices.
3. **Dynamic Floor Pricing:** Implements adjustable floor prices based on ad size and device type.
4. **Bid Validation:** Fully compliant with OpenRTB protocol, including validation of critical fields such as:
   - `price`
   - `advertiserDomain`
   - `creativeId`
   - `adm`
5. **Lazy Loading:** Ad units are loaded dynamically only when visible in the viewport.
6. **Fallback Ads:** Displays default ads in cases where no valid bids are received.
7. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error logging for debugging invalid or failed bid responses.
8. **Analytics Integration:** Tracks bid-related events and performance metrics using Google Analytics.
9. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automates testing, linting, and deployment processes using GitHub Actions.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **NPM** (Node Package Manager)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/header-bidding-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd header-bidding-system
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the application (for development):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. Add the header bidding script to your webpage:
   ```html
   <script src="header-bidding.js"></script>
   ```
2. Define ad slots in your HTML.
3. Integrate Google Analytics for bid tracking (replace `UA-XXXXX-Y` with your property ID).

## Testing

### Lint the Code
Run the linter to ensure code quality:
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Execute Unit Tests
Run unit tests to validate functionality:
```bash
npm test
```

### Verify CI/CD Pipeline
Push changes to the `main` branch and monitor the Actions tab on GitHub to verify automated workflows.

## File Structure
- **header-bidding.js:** Core implementation file.
- **.github/workflows/main.yml:** Configuration for CI/CD pipeline.
- **README.md:** Project documentation.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Dynamic Floor Pricing:** Developed a robust and flexible pricing mechanism adaptable to various ad sizes and devices.
2. **Bid Validation:** Ensured compliance with OpenRTB protocol to guarantee compatibility with SSP requirements.
3. **Error Handling:** Implemented detailed error logging for improved debugging and system resilience.

## Future Enhancements

1. Expand support for additional SSPs to increase competition.
2. Add support for more ad formats, such as video ads.
3. Optimize bid latency to handle high-traffic environments efficiently.
