Header Bidding System Implementation

Overview

This project implements a simplified header bidding system to optimize ad revenue for a publisher's website. It uses Prebid.js as the core framework and supports multiple Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs). Key features include dynamic floor pricing, bid validation, analytics integration, and a CI/CD pipeline for deployment.

Features

Core Features

Prebid.js Setup: Configured with two demand partners (AppNexus and Pubmatic).

Ad Unit Configuration: Responsive ad units for both desktop and mobile devices.

Dynamic Floor Pricing: Adjustable floor prices based on ad size and device type.

Bid Validation: Validates incoming bids using OpenRTB protocol fields.

Lazy Loading: Ad units are loaded dynamically when visible in the viewport.

Fallback Ads: Default ads are displayed if no valid bids are received.

Error Handling: Logs errors for failed or invalid bid responses.

Analytics Integration

Google Analytics: Tracks bid events such as bid wins and performance metrics.

CI/CD Pipeline

Automates testing, linting, and deployment using GitHub Actions.

Ensures quality and reliability through continuous integration.
